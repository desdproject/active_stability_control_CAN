# active_stability_control_CAN
In this project, we are using use CAN controllers, transceivers within ARM-Cortex-M3 board as communication unit to provide/setup ESC and ABS to maintain vehicle stability and prevent wheel lock-up during braking. MEMS(Micro Electro Mechanical Sensor) is used for tracking &amp; finding location of vehicle  which will be send through GSM.
